                Recent research indicates a complex relationship between academic performance and health behaviors among high school students. 
                Studies show that higher academic grades are often associated with more positive individual and cumulative health behaviors, suggesting that students who perform well in school may also engage in healthier lifestyle choices. 
                Conversely, youth risk behaviors, such as substance use, physical inactivity, and poor dietary habits, are consistently linked to lower grades, lower test scores, and ultimately, reduced educational attainment. 
                This highlights the critical role that academic success can play in shaping not only educational outcomes but also broader health and well-being in adolescents.

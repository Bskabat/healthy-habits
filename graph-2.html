			We chose this one graph because it displays the results of users and shows us the amount of students for how much hours of sleep they get.
			The average amount of sleep for a student is about 7-8 hours, which is below the recommended amount which is 8-10 per night.

                Getting 8-10 hours of sleep is essential for high school students because it supports their physical growth, mental well-being, and academic performance. 
                During sleep, the brain processes and retains information, which improves memory and learningâ€”both crucial for success in school. 
                Adequate rest also helps regulate mood and reduce stress, making it easier to handle the pressures of assignments, exams, and social interactions. 
                Additionally, sleep is important for overall health, as it strengthens the immune system and reduces the risk of illnesses. 
                Without enough rest, students may experience difficulty concentrating, lower energy levels, and decreased productivity, all of which can negatively impact their academic and personal lives.

            <p class = "text-3">Regular exercise not only boosts your mood in the moment but can also have lasting effects throughout the week. 
			When you work out, your body releases endorphins, which are chemicals that help reduce stress and elevate your mood. 
			This immediate boost can last for hours, but if you exercise periodically, the cumulative effect becomes even more significant. 
			By sticking to a workout routine, you establish a consistent release of these mood-enhancing endorphins, leading to improved mental clarity, reduced anxiety, and a greater sense of well-being throughout the entire week. 
			This regularity helps your body and mind adapt, making it easier to handle stress and maintain a positive outlook, even on tough days.

			why we chose this one graph is because it demostrates how many percent of people can focus on 8 hour of sleep verses sometimes verses no focus.
			This graph is shows results of people's focus compared to sleep, showing what people say about their focus if they have 8 hours of sleep.
			<!--Getting a full 8 hours of sleep is essential for maintaining optimal focus throughout the day. 
			During sleep, the brain consolidates memories, processes information, and clears out toxins, which helps improve cognitive function. 
			With sufficient rest, your mind is more alert, sharper, and better able to concentrate on tasks, whether it's work, study, or everyday activities. 
			Sleep also supports the regulation of emotions, which can prevent distractions caused by stress or irritability. 
			When well-rested, you're able to think more clearly, make decisions more effectively, and sustain attention for longer periods, ultimately leading to improved productivity and mental clarity.
